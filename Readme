HealthChat

Overview

HealthChat is a project that leverages web scraping, natural language processing, and LLM to provide users with insights into health-related symptoms and their causes. By collecting and processing data from various health-related websites, this tool enables users to ask questions about their symptoms and receive relevant, accurate responses.

Project Structure

1. Data Scraping
Data Sources: Collected data from multiple health websites to ensure a comprehensive understanding of symptoms and their potential causes.
Scraping Method: Utilized Scrapy to extract relevant information efficiently.
2. Data Processing
Chunking: The scraped data was organized into manageable chunks to facilitate easier analysis and querying.
Storage: All processed data was saved into a CSV file named chunk.csv, which serves as a structured repository of symptoms and causes.
3. Snowflake Integration
Data Upload: The chunk.csv file was uploaded to Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehousing solution, allowing for scalable data management.
Embedding Creation:
Employed the e5-base-v2 model from Snowflake Cortex to generate embeddings for the symptom-related data.
Used the function snowflake.cortex.embed_text_768('snowflake-arctic-embed-m') for vector cosine similarity, enabling efficient similarity searches.
4. Question Answering with LLAMA2
Model Selection: Utilized the LLAMA2 70B Chat model to provide responses to user queries about symptoms.
Functionality: The model is designed to interpret user questions and deliver accurate answers based on the data.
