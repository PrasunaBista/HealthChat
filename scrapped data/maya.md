### What are symptoms of serious diseases and health problems?

![Image 1: Symptoms of serious diseases and health problems](https://images.medicinenet.com/images/Article/main_image/asthma-attack-shortness-breath-chest-pain-lungs-inhalation.jpg?output-quality=75)

Never ignore the signs or symptoms of a serious disease or health problem.

When is a [cough](https://www.medicinenet.com/chronic_cough/article.htm) "just" a cough, or a [headache](https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm) a symptom to be concerned about? Listed are signs and symptoms that could indicate a serious health condition, and you should see a doctor if you experience any symptoms of concern. Sometimes, a symptom in one part of the body may be a sign of a problem in another part of the body. Moreover, unrelated symptoms that might be minor on their own could be warning signs of a more serious medical disease or condition. Listen to your body, note all symptoms, and share them in detail with your doctor.

Types of serious diseases and health problems include:

*   [Heart attack](https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm)
*   [Stroke](https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm)
*   Reproductive health
*   Breast problems
*   Lung problems
*   Stomach or digestive problems
*   Bladder problems
*   Skin problems
*   Muscle or joint problems
*   Emotional problems
*   Headache[](https://www.medicinenet.com/migraine_headaches_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) problems (not including everyday tension [headaches](https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm))
*   Eating or weight problems
