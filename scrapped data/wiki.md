Signs (including [enlarged liver and spleen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatosplenomegaly "Hepatosplenomegaly")) and symptoms (including headache and vomiting) of acute [HIV infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_infection "HIV infection")

**Signs and symptoms** are the observed or detectable signs, and experienced symptoms of an [illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease "Disease"), injury, or condition.

Signs are objective and externally observable; symptoms are a person's reported subjective experiences.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-1)

A sign for example may be a higher or lower temperature than normal, raised or lowered blood pressure or an abnormality showing on a [medical scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging "Medical imaging"). A symptom is something out of the ordinary that is experienced by an individual such as feeling feverish, a headache or other pains in the body.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-CTG-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-NHS-3)

A medical sign is an [objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(science) "Objectivity (science)") observable indication of a disease, injury, or [medical condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_condition "Medical condition") that may be detected during a [physical examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_examination "Physical examination").[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-MW2-4) These signs may be visible, such as a [rash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash "Rash") or [bruise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruise "Bruise"), or otherwise detectable such as by [using a stethoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auscultation "Auscultation") or taking [blood pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure "Blood pressure"). Medical signs, along with [symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptom "Symptom"), help in forming a [diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis "Medical diagnosis"). Some examples of signs are [nail clubbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_clubbing "Nail clubbing") of either the fingernails or toenails[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-r465-5) or an [abnormal gait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormal_gait "Abnormal gait").[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-g049-6)

A _sign_ is different from an "_[indication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indication_(medicine) "Indication (medicine)")_" – the activity of a condition 'pointing to' (thus "indicating") a remedy, not the reverse (viz., it is not a remedy 'pointing to' a condition)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-7) – which is a specific reason for using a particular [treatment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy "Therapy").\[_[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")_\]

A symptom is something felt or experienced, such as pain or dizziness. Signs and symptoms are not mutually exclusive, for example a subjective feeling of fever can be noted as sign by using a thermometer that registers a high reading.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-8) The [CDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention") lists various diseases by their signs and symptoms such as for [measles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles#Signs_and_symptoms "Measles") which includes a high [fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever "Fever"), [conjunctivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis "Conjunctivitis"), and [cough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough "Cough"), followed a few days later by the measles [rash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maculopapular_rash "Maculopapular rash").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-CDC1-9)

### Cardinal signs and symptoms

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Signs_and_symptoms&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Cardinal signs and symptoms")\]

Cardinal signs and symptoms are very specific even to the point of being [pathognomonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathognomonic "Pathognomonic"). A cardinal sign or cardinal symptom can also refer to the major sign or symptom of a disease.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Basu-10) Abnormal [reflexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex "Reflex") can indicate problems with the [nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system "Nervous system"). Signs and symptoms are also applied to physiological states outside the context of disease, as for example when referring to the [signs and symptoms of pregnancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms_of_pregnancy "Signs and symptoms of pregnancy"), or the symptoms of [dehydration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration "Dehydration"). Sometimes a disease may be present without showing any signs or symptoms when it is known as being [asymptomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic "Asymptomatic").[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-MW-11) The disorder may be discovered through tests including scans. An [infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection "Infection") may be asymptomatic but still be [transmissible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine) "Transmission (medicine)").[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-MW-11)

Signs and symptoms are often non-specific, but some combinations can be suggestive of certain [diagnoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis "Medical diagnosis"), helping to narrow down what may be wrong. A particular set of characteristic signs and symptoms that may be associated with a disorder is known as a [syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome "Syndrome").

When a disease is evidenced by symptoms it is known as **symptomatic**. There are many conditions including [subclinical infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclinical_infection "Subclinical infection") that display no symptoms, and these are termed [asymptomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic "Asymptomatic").

Signs and symptoms may be mild or severe, brief or longer-lasting when they may become reduced ([remission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine) "Remission (medicine)")), or then recur ([relapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse "Relapse") or [recrudescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recrudescence "Recrudescence")) known as a [flare-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease#Stages "Disease"). A flare-up may show more severe symptoms.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Shiel_2019-12)

The term [chief complaint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_complaint "Chief complaint"), also "presenting problem", is used to describe the initial concern of an individual when seeking medical help, and once this is clearly noted a [history of the present illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_present_illness "History of the present illness") may be taken. The symptom that ultimately leads to a [diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis "Diagnosis") is called a cardinal symptom.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] Some symptoms can be misleading as a result of [referred pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referred_pain "Referred pain"), where for example a pain in the right shoulder may be due to [an inflamed gallbladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecystitis "Cholecystitis") and not to presumed muscle strain.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Harrison's-13)

Many diseases have an early [prodromal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodromal "Prodromal") stage where a few signs and symptoms may suggest the presence of a disorder before further specific symptoms may emerge. [Measles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles "Measles") for example has a prodromal presentation that includes a hacking cough, fever, and [Koplik's spots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koplik%27s_spots "Koplik's spots") in the mouth.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-MSD-14) Over half of [migraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine "Migraine") episodes have a prodromal phase.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Five2004-15) [Schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia#Onset "Schizophrenia") has a notable prodromal stage,[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-DSM5-16) as has [dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia#Prodromal "Dementia").[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Sherman-17)

### Nonspecific symptoms

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Signs_and_symptoms&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Nonspecific symptoms")\]

Some symptoms are _specific_, that is, they are associated with a single, specific medical condition.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

_Nonspecific symptoms_, sometimes also called _equivocal symptoms_,[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-18) are not specific to a particular condition. They include unexplained weight loss, headache, pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, night sweats, and [malaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise "Malaise").[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-concept-19) A group of three particular nonspecific symptoms – fever, night sweats, and weight loss – over a period of six months are termed [B symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_symptoms "B symptoms") associated with [lymphoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma "Lymphoma") and indicate a poor prognosis.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-ILS-20)

Other sub-types of symptoms include:

*   _constitutional_ or _general symptoms_, which affect general well-being or the whole body, such as a fever;[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-21)[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-22)
*   _concomitant symptoms_, which are symptoms that occur at the same time as the primary symptom;[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-23)
*   _prodromal symptoms_, which are the first symptoms of an bigger set of problems;[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-24)
*   _delayed symptoms_, which happen some time after the trigger;[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-25) and
*   _objective symptoms_, which are symptoms whose existence can be observed and confirmed by a healthcare provider.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-26)

[Vital signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_signs "Vital signs") are the four signs that can give an immediate measurement of the body's overall functioning and health status. They are [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_temperature "Body temperature"), [heart rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate "Heart rate"), [breathing rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_rate "Breathing rate"), and [blood pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure "Blood pressure"). The [ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ranges "Reference ranges") of these measurements vary with age, weight, gender and with general health.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-ProHealth-27)

A digital application has been developed for use in clinical settings that measures three of the vital signs (not temperature) using just a [smartphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone "Smartphone"), and has been approved by [NHS England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_England "NHS England"). The application is registered as _Lifelight First_, and _Lifelight Home_ is under development (2020) for monitoring-use by people at home using just the camera on their smartphone or tablet. This will additionally measure [oxygen saturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation_(medicine) "Oxygen saturation (medicine)") and [atrial fibrillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation "Atrial fibrillation"). Other devices are then not needed.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-AI-28)

Many conditions are indicated by a group of known signs, or signs and symptoms. These can be a group of three known as a triad; a group of four ("tetrad"); or a group of five ("pentad").\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

An example of a triad is [Meltzer's triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltzer%27s_triad "Meltzer's triad") presenting [purpura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpura "Purpura") a rash, [arthralgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthralgia "Arthralgia") painful joints, and [myalgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgia "Myalgia") painful and weak muscles. Meltzer's triad indicates the condition [cryoglobulinemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryoglobulinemia "Cryoglobulinemia"). [Huntington's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease "Huntington's disease") is a [neurodegenerative disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegenerative_disease "Neurodegenerative disease") that is characterized by a triad of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric signs and symptoms.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Jensen-29) A large number of these groups that can be characteristic of a particular disease are known as a [syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome "Syndrome"). [Noonan syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noonan_syndrome "Noonan syndrome") for example, has a diagnostic set of unique facial and musculoskeletal features.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Genetics-30) Some syndromes such as [nephrotic syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrotic_syndrome "Nephrotic syndrome") may have a number of underlying causes that are all related to diseases that affect the [kidneys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney "Kidney").[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-NIDDK-31)

Sometimes a child or young adult may have symptoms suggestive of a [genetic disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder "Genetic disorder") that cannot be [identified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis "Diagnosis") even after [genetic testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing "Genetic testing"). In such cases the term [SWAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome_without_a_name "Syndrome without a name") (syndrome without a name) may be used. Often a diagnosis may be made at some future point when other more specific symptoms emerge but many cases may remain undiagnosed. The inability to diagnose may be due to a unique combination of symptoms or an overlap of conditions, or to the symptoms being atypical of a known disorder, or to the disorder being extremely rare.[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-swan-32)

It is possible that a person with a particular syndrome might not display every single one of the signs and/or symptoms that compose/define a syndrome.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

### Positive and negative

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Signs_and_symptoms&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Positive and negative")\]

Sensory symptoms can also be described as **positive symptoms**, or as **negative symptoms** depending on whether the symptom is abnormally present such as tingling or itchiness, or abnormally absent such as [loss of smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosmia "Anosmia"). The following terms are used for negative symptoms – [hypoesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoesthesia "Hypoesthesia") is a partial loss of sensitivity to moderate stimuli, such as pressure, touch, warmth, cold. [Anesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia "Anesthesia") is the complete loss of sensitivity to stronger stimuli, such as pinprick. [Hypoalgesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoalgesia "Hypoalgesia") (analgesia) is loss of sensation to painful stimuli.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-33)

Symptoms are also grouped in to negative and positive for some [mental disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder "Mental disorder") such as [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia "Schizophrenia").[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-SGG-34) [Positive symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia#Positive_symptoms "Schizophrenia") are those that are present in the disorder and are not normally experienced by most individuals and reflects an excess or distortion of normal functions;[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Understanding_Psychosis_Fact_Sheet-35) examples are [hallucinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinations "Hallucinations"), [delusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusions "Delusions"), and bizarre behavior.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] [Negative symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia#Negative_symptoms "Schizophrenia") are functions that are normally found but that are diminished or absent, such as [apathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy "Apathy") and [anhedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia "Anhedonia").[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Understanding_Psychosis_Fact_Sheet-35)

Dynamic symptoms are capable of change depending on circumstance, whereas static symptoms are fixed or unchanging regardless of circumstance. For example, the symptoms of [exercise intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_intolerance "Exercise intolerance") are dynamic as they are brought on by exercise, but alleviate during rest. Fixed [muscle weakness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness "Muscle weakness") is a static symptom as the muscle will be weak regardless of exercise or rest.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

A majority of patients with [metabolic myopathies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_myopathy "Metabolic myopathy") have dynamic rather than static findings, typically experiencing exercise intolerance, muscle pain, and cramps with exercise rather than fixed weakness.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-36) Those with the metabolic myopathy of [McArdle's disease (GSD-V)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_storage_disease_type_V "Glycogen storage disease type V") and some individuals with [phosphoglucomutase deficiency (CDG1T/GSD-XIV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoglucomutase#Disease_relevance "Phosphoglucomutase"), initially experience exercise intolerance during mild-moderate aerobic exercise, but the symptoms alleviate after 6–10 minutes in what is known as "[second wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_wind "Second wind")".

Neuropsychiatric symptoms are present in many [degenerative disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disorder "Degenerative disorder") including [dementia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia "Dementia"), and [Parkinson's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease"). Symptoms commonly include [apathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy "Apathy"), [anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety "Anxiety"), and [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood) "Depression (mood)").[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Mueller-37) [Neurological and psychiatric symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_disease#Neuropsychiatric_symptoms "Wilson's disease") are also present in some [genetic disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder "Genetic disorder") such as [Wilson's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_disease "Wilson's disease").[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-NIDDK1-38) Symptoms of [executive dysfunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_dysfunction "Executive dysfunction") are often found in many disorders including [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia "Schizophrenia"), and [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD "ADHD").[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Lesh-39)[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Brown-40)

[Radiologic signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiologic_sign "Radiologic sign") are abnormal [medical findings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_findings "Medical findings") on [imaging scanning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging "Medical imaging"). These include the [Mickey Mouse sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse_sign "Mickey Mouse sign") and the [Golden S sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_S_sign "Golden S sign"). When using imaging to find the cause of a complaint, another unrelated finding may be found known as an [incidental finding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidental_imaging_finding "Incidental imaging finding").[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-BMJ18-41)

Cardinal signs and symptoms are those that may be diagnostic, and [pathognomonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathognomonic "Pathognomonic") – of a certainty of diagnosis. [Inflammation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation#Cardinal_signs "Inflammation") for example has a recognised group of cardinal signs and symptoms,[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Freire-42) as does [exacerbations of chronic bronchitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis#Chronic_bronchitis "Bronchitis"),[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-43) and [Parkinson's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms_of_Parkinson%27s_disease#Cardinal_signs "Signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease").

In contrast to a pathognomonic cardinal sign, the absence of a sign or symptom can often rule out a condition. This is known by the Latin term _[sine qua non](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_qua_non "Sine qua non")_. For example, the absence of known genetic mutations [specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity "Sensitivity and specificity") for a [hereditary disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_disease "Hereditary disease") would rule out that disease.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Lynch-44) Another example is where the [vaginal pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina#Infections,_diseases,_and_safe_sex "Vagina") is less than 4.5, a diagnosis of [bacterial vaginosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_vaginosis "Bacterial vaginosis") would be excluded.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Manka-45)

A [reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex "Reflex") is an automatic response in the body to a stimulus.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-M-W-46) Its absence, reduced (hypoactive), or exaggerated (hyperactive) response can be a sign of damage to the [central nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system "Central nervous system") or [peripheral nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system "Peripheral nervous system"). In the [patellar reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellar_reflex "Patellar reflex") (knee-jerk) for example, its reduction or absence is known as [Westphal's sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphal%27s_sign "Westphal's sign") and may indicate damage to [lower motor neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_motor_neuron_lesion "Lower motor neuron lesion"). When the response is exaggerated damage to the [upper motor neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_motor_neuron_lesion "Upper motor neuron lesion") may be indicated.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

A number of [medical conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_condition "Medical condition") are associated with a distinctive facial expression or appearance known as a [facies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facies_(medical) "Facies (medical)").[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-M-W2-47) An example is [elfin facies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfin_facies "Elfin facies") which has facial features like those of the [elf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf "Elf"), and this may be associated with [Williams syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_syndrome "Williams syndrome"), or [Donohue syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donohue_syndrome "Donohue syndrome"). The most well-known facies is probably the [Hippocratic facies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_facies "Hippocratic facies") that is seen on a person as they near death.[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Chadwick_1978-48)

[Anamnestic signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history "Medical history") (from _anamnēstikós_, ἀναμνηστικός, "able to recall to mind") are signs that indicate a past condition, for example paralysis in an arm may indicate a past [stroke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke "Stroke").[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-King_1982-49): 81

Some diseases including [cancers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer "Cancer"), and infections may be present but show no signs or symptoms and these are known as [asymptomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic "Asymptomatic").[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-MW-11) A gallstone may be asymptomatic and only discovered as an [incidental finding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidental_finding "Incidental finding").[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-MW-11) Easily spreadable viral infections such as [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19") may be asymptomatic but may still be [transmissible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(medicine) "Transmission (medicine)").[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Lancet-50)

A symptom (from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language") σύμπτωμα, "accident, misfortune, that which befalls",[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-51) from συμπίπτω, "I befall", from συν- "together, with" and πίπτω, "I fall") is a departure from normal function or feeling.

Prior to the nineteenth century there was little difference in the powers of observation between physician and patient. Most medical practice was conducted as a co-operative interaction between the physician and patient; this was gradually replaced by a "monolithic consensus of opinion imposed from within the community of medical investigators".[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Jewson_1974-56)[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-Jewson_1976-57) Whilst each noticed much the same things, the physician had a more informed interpretation of those things: "the physicians knew what the findings meant and the layman did not".[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms#cite_note-King_1982-49): 82
